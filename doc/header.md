# Vanilla Utils
This is a zero-dependency collection of utility tools that will help development on vanilla-js a bit easier for you.
I have always appreciated the no-framework idea for most small projects which do not require a lot of maintenance.
And these are the sets of tools that I have always had in my projects in some way or form. I have compiled them here with improvements such that they are helpful in a more macroscopic level.
I will keep updating it with more tools.

Below is the documentation for this project.
